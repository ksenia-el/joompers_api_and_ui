# to use the fixture - just mention it as a parameter of test
# and later, inside the test itself, you can run API-calls on the authorized session returned by fixture

# - logs into the user account created
# - returns: 1) session of this user being authorized 2) email of the user account 3) password of the user account

# to get values that returned by fixture in test - just address to them as regular variables, like that:
